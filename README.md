# Getx Localization Tutorial

Changing the language of an application written in Flutter was done with the help of the "GetX" library.

## Working logic of the application;
First, it is checked whether there is a language registered in Hive. If the user has specifically selected any language, that language will be used. If there is no selected language, the device language is automatically preferred.

## Libraries used;
- get: ^4.6.6
- hive: ^2.2.1
- hive_flutter: ^1.1.0
- timezone: ^0.9.0
